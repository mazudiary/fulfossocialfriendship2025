# 🌸 fulfossocialfriendship2025

A magical and interactive memory journey created to celebrate 6 years of beautiful friendship with **Fulfos** — my finest sister from another blood.

This project is a heartfelt digital experience made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It captures shared memories, gentle jokes, a loving message, and the unspoken emotions of a brother-sister bond built on time, respect, and deep connection.
